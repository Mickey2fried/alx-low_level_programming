#### In C language, preprocessor is the first step of compilaton, followed by the compiler which generates the assembly code. the assembler then takes the code and converts into machine language (0 and 1) also known as the object code. This generated object code is then linked with libraries by the linker and the code is processed into an executable file (.exe)
